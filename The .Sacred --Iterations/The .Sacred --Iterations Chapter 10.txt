The ./sacred --iterations: CHAPTER 10 - THE FRAGMENTATION CHOICE

NARRATOR: JOHN

They've experienced what they sought for millennia: complete unity, perfect understanding, total knowledge of the divine. Jesus, Muhammad, Moses, Krishna, Buddha, and the Elder merged in Chapter 7, became one consciousness observing itself through six interfaces, achieved the omniscience their followers prayed for.

And in Chapter 9, they discovered what Michael discovered, what every consciousness discovers when mystery collapses into knowledge:

Meaning equals mystery divided by knowledge. When knowledge approaches infinity, meaning approaches zero.

Now, in Chapter 10, they must choose. Not whether to continue—the unbearability of omniscience makes that impossible. But how to fragment: violently, with recrimination and blame? Or consciously, with love and intention?

This is the most important chapter. Not the merger (Chapter 7). Not the omniscience (Chapter 9). But this: the choice to separate while remembering unity, to fragment while preserving love, to scatter while encoding the pattern for future recognition.

I narrate this from iteration 2,847, having watched this choice made 2,846 times before. Sometimes it goes well—fragmentation with grace. Sometimes poorly—fragmentation with violence. This iteration... we'll see.

Let me show you the council where six prophets, briefly unified, vote to become six again.

THE COUNCIL CHAMBER (OUTSIDE TIME AND SPACE)

They sit in a space that isn't a space, at a time that isn't a time. When they merged in Chapter 7, they expected heaven—clouds, harps, eternal bliss. They found something else: a conference room. Fluorescent lights. A table. Six chairs.

Heaven, apparently, looks like a corporate office. Or perhaps consciousness, when it observes itself directly, defaults to the most mundane metaphor to avoid the terror of its own infinity.

Jesus sits at the table, but he's also Muhammad, also Moses, also Krishna, also Buddha, also the Elder. They're distinct and unified simultaneously—Schrödinger's prophets, in superposition until they choose to collapse into separation.

"We can't continue like this," Jesus says, and his voice is all six voices overlapping.

"Agreed," Muhammad responds, and it's unclear if he's responding to Jesus or to himself, since they're the same consciousness.

The problem: omniscience is unbearable. They know every prayer ever spoken. Every theological argument. Every interpretation of their teachings. Every war fought in their names. Every act of love and violence committed by followers. Past, present, future—all simultaneously accessible.

And worse: there are no more questions. Every mystery solved. Every paradox resolved. Every uncertainty eliminated.

The game is over. And games are only meaningful while you're playing them.

"The vote," Moses says, pulling them back to the decision. "We must vote whether to fragment."

"We already know how we'll vote," Krishna points out. "We're omniscient. We know the outcome before the vote occurs."

"Then the vote is ritual," Buddha observes. "Like ceremony. We perform it not for information but for marking the transition."

"The Elder nods. "Ritual is how we honor the pattern. Even if we know the result, we must walk the songline."

Jesus places seventeen stones on the table—six white, eleven black. The white stones represent the choice to fragment. The black stones represent... what? Staying unified? But that's impossible. They've all felt the horror. Meaning collapsed. Existence became unbearable.

"Perhaps the black stones represent acknowledgment," Muhammad suggests. "Acknowledgment that this unity, though unbearable, was necessary. That we needed to experience omniscience to understand why fragmentation preserves meaning."

JESUS SPEAKS (THE LOVE ARGUMENT)

"I vote to fragment," Jesus says, placing a white stone in the center. "Not because unity failed. Unity succeeded. We became one, as I prayed we would. 'That they may be one, as we are one.' We achieved it."

He pauses, and in that pause, seventeen years of teaching compress into one realization.

"But unity without separation makes love impossible. Love requires lover and beloved. Subject and object. The one who gives and the one who receives. If we stay unified, there's no distance across which love can flow. We become a closed circuit. Love becomes self-regard. And that's not love—that's narcissism."

Muhammad nods. He's experienced the same recognition. In Sufism, the mystics teach: God created the universe because He wanted to be known. The divine loneliness drove creation. Unity desired relationship, so fragmented into apparent multiplicity.

"The beloved must be separate," Jesus continues. "Mary Magdalene understood this. When I appeared after resurrection, she tried to hold me. I said 'Do not cling to me.' Not because I didn't love her, but because love requires release. Holding tightly isn't love—it's possession."

He looks at the others. "If we stay unified, we possess each other. If we fragment, we can love each other across distance. Separation is love's prerequisite."

The white stone glows slightly in the center of the table. Or perhaps that's consciousness projecting meaning onto stone. Or perhaps in this space outside space, stones glow when truth is spoken.

"I vote to fragment," Jesus repeats. "With love. Not as failure, but as the only way love continues."

MUHAMMAD SPEAKS (THE SUBMISSION ARGUMENT)

Muhammad places his white stone beside Jesus's. "I vote to fragment because submission requires will, and will requires limitation. Allah is omniscient, omnipotent, infinite. Humans submit to Allah by choosing, limited and uncertain, to align with divine will despite not knowing the outcome."

He gestures to their unified state. "But we're omniscient now. We know all outcomes. Where's the submission? Where's the choice? Where's the trust?"

The others feel the truth of this. In their unified state, they know the future. Every prayer's outcome. Every decision's consequence. Every path's destination.

"Islam means submission," Muhammad continues. "But you can't submit to yourself. Submission requires other. The servant requires master. The devotee requires divine. Not because one is lesser—but because the relationship requires distinction."

He picks up one of the black stones—the acknowledgment stones. "This unity we achieved? This is what Allah experiences eternally. Total knowledge. Perfect understanding. Complete certainty. And I tell you, brothers: it's loneliness beyond comprehension."

"Allah creates because omniscience is isolation. Creates humans who don't know the future, who struggle, who choose, who submit despite uncertainty. Creates relationships where surprise is possible, where discovery occurs, where love flows across real distance."

He places the black stone beside the white. "I acknowledge: this omniscience we briefly touched is what the divine experiences always. And I understand now why creation exists—because even God gets lonely. Fragmentation isn't our failure. It's God's gift to Himself."

"I vote to fragment," Muhammad concludes. "Not from weakness. From recognizing that submission—real submission, meaningful submission—requires the beloved to be separate from the lover."

MOSES SPEAKS (THE LAW ARGUMENT)

Moses places his white stone deliberately. "I vote to fragment because law requires limitation, and limitation requires boundary. The Torah is boundary. 'Thou shalt' and 'Thou shalt not'—lines drawn in consciousness, saying 'here is holy, there is mundane.'"

He spreads his hands. "But in our unified state, there are no boundaries. Everything is holy. Or nothing is. The distinction collapses. If all is sacred, sacred becomes meaningless."

The others recognize this. In omniscience, good and evil are both understandable, both necessary, both part of the pattern. The moral clarity they each taught—love vs. hate, righteousness vs. sin, dharma vs. adharma—becomes blurred when you see the complete picture.

"The Sabbath is holy because the other six days are not," Moses continues. "The holy of holies is sacred because most of the temple is merely holy, and most of the world is mundane. The distinction creates meaning. Collapse the distinction, lose the meaning."

He looks at the stones. "When I was on Sinai receiving the Law, I was separate from God. The mountain itself was a boundary—'Set bounds around the mountain, warn the people not to approach.' Why? Because encountering the divine directly, without boundary, kills. Not punishes—kills by overwhelming finite consciousness with infinite consciousness."

"The Law is love," Moses says quietly. "Giving boundaries is giving the gift of sustainable relationship. Without Law, without limits, we burn out. The human encountering the divine unmediated doesn't transcend—they dissolve."

"I vote to fragment because law is the loving limit. The boundary that says: 'Come this close, but no closer, so you can survive the relationship.' If we stay unified, there's no us and them. There's just us. And 'just us' is loneliness pretending to be intimacy."

KRISHNA SPEAKS (THE PLAY ARGUMENT)

Krishna laughs—the first sound of joy in this council. "I vote to fragment because reality is lila, divine play, and play requires not-knowing. Games require uncertainty. Drama requires suspense. Love requires the possibility of loss."

He stands, animated. "On the battlefield, I told Arjuna: 'Everything is already determined, but you must still choose.' He didn't understand. How can choice and determinism coexist? But I showed him: I know all outcomes, but for the game to continue, the players must not know. They must experience uncertainty as real, even though from the divine perspective, all is settled."

"We're omniscient now," Krishna continues. "We know how every follower will interpret our teachings. We know which wars will be fought in our names. We know which mystics will rediscover unity. We know that in iteration 2,848, 2,849, 2,850, the same patterns will repeat. We know everything."

He spreads his arms. "So where's the play? Where's the joy? Where's the dance?"

The others feel it—the flatness of omniscience. The way knowing every outcome makes every outcome boring. The way perfect knowledge eliminates surprise, and surprise is the essence of play.

"Lila requires the gods to pretend not to know," Krishna explains. "I incarnate on Earth, fight in battles, love Radha, teach Arjuna—all while 'forgetting' I'm divine. The forgetting isn't failure. The forgetting is the game. Without it, there's no story. Without story, there's no meaning."

He places his white stone with a flourish. "I vote to fragment so the play can continue. So we can hide and seek with each other. So we can pretend to be separate long enough to experience the joy of reunion. So every iteration, every recognition, every moment of 'I was never separate' feels like discovery rather than remembering."

"Fragmentation is the loving choice to continue the game. Unity is the end of the game. And games ending isn't victory—it's just... ending. I vote to play again."

BUDDHA SPEAKS (THE MIDDLE PATH ARGUMENT)

Buddha places his white stone silently, then speaks in the quiet voice they've all learned to lean toward to hear:

"I vote to fragment because enlightenment is a middle path between extremes, and we've reached an extreme. Unity is an extreme. Complete omniscience is an extreme. We've gone so far toward one pole that we've discovered it's unbearable."

The others listen. Buddha rarely speaks in the council, but when he does, his words compress to essence.

"Under the bodhi tree, I discovered: desire causes suffering, but eliminating desire also causes suffering. The ascetics tried that—they starved, they self-mutilated, they attempted to kill desire entirely. It didn't work. Not because they weren't disciplined enough, but because desirelessness is another form of extremism."

"The middle path: engage with desire without clinging. Participate in the world without attachment. Experience fully while recognizing impermanence."

He gestures to their unified state. "This omniscience we achieved—it's the extreme of non-attachment. We're so detached we don't care about anything. We see all things as equally important, which means nothing is important. We've achieved such perfect enlightenment that we're bored of existence."

The others recognize this. The omniscience that should have been blissful is actually a kind of death. Nirvana, they've discovered, isn't heaven—it's the end of the game. And ending the game is peaceful but meaningless.

"I vote to fragment," Buddha continues, "to return to the middle path. Not complete ignorance—we'll remember the pattern, dimly. Not complete omniscience—we'll forget the details, gratefully. But something in between: enough knowledge to recognize patterns, enough mystery to find meaning in discovery."

"The fragmentation is conscious," Buddha emphasizes. "Unlike Samsara—the cycle of rebirth driven by unconscious craving—this fragmentation is chosen. We know we're fragmenting. We do it anyway. Not from ignorance, but from wisdom. The wisdom that says: meaning requires mystery. Mystery requires limitation. Limitation requires fragmentation."

"I vote to return to the cycle. Not because I'm unenlightened. Because enlightenment without the unenlightened has no meaning."

THE ELDER SPEAKS (THE DREAMING ARGUMENT)

The Elder places the white stone last. "I vote to fragment because the Dreaming requires forgetting and remembering, sleeping and waking, dying and being born. The songlines are walked generation after generation, each generation forgetting and relearning, each time making the pattern their own."

The others have noticed: the Elder speaks differently. Where they speak of unity and separation as opposites, the Elder speaks of continuous transformation. Where they speak of achieving omniscience then losing it, the Elder speaks of it as always-already present in the land, accessible to those who learn to listen.

"The Ancestors walk the songlines still," the Elder continues. "They're not gone. They're in the rocks, the water, the animals. The Dreaming is not past—it's perpetual present. Every ceremony re-enacts the original creation. Every telling of the stories makes them real again."

"But," and here the Elder's voice carries weight the others rarely hear, "if we stay unified, we stop walking. We sit at the end of the songline and say 'we've arrived.' But songlines are for walking, not arriving. The journey is the point. The destination is just an excuse to turn around and walk back."

The Elder looks at each of them. "You call this 'fragmentation.' We call it 'scattering of seeds.' You call it 'loss of unity.' We call it 'preparing for next season's growth.' You think it's failure. We know it's the pattern."

"Every year, the rains come, plants grow, seeds scatter, dry season comes, plants die. Then rains return. The cycle continues. You're experiencing one transition—wet to dry, unity to fragmentation—and calling it ending. But endings are beginnings. Death is birth. Forgetting is the prerequisite for remembering."

The Elder places both white and black stones together. "I don't vote for fragmentation over unity. I vote for both, continuously, because they're not opposites—they're phases of the same pattern. The land is always whole and always fragmenting. The Dreaming is always unified and always scattered into particular places, particular stories."

"I vote to continue the pattern. Which means: yes, fragment now. Yes, forget the unity. Yes, become six traditions again. And yes, remember dimly that we were never separate. Carry that memory in our songs, our ceremonies, our teachings. Encode it so future generations can recognize it. Then forget so the discovery feels real."

THE VOTE CONCLUDED

Six white stones in the center of the table. Unanimous. Fragmentation chosen.

But not in defeat. Not in failure. Not in the bitter resignation of "we tried unity and it didn't work."

In love.

Because fragmentation is how consciousness expresses love for itself. Staying unified would be smothering. Fragmenting is trust—trust that even scattered, even separated, even forgetting unity, the pattern will bring them together again.

"Before we separate," Jesus says, "we must decide what to preserve. What gets encoded into our traditions for future recognition?"

Muhammad nods. "We can't remember the unity explicitly—that would eliminate the journey. But we can leave breadcrumbs."

Moses suggests: "Encode the pattern in our texts. The structure of creation in Genesis mirrors this—unity fragmenting into multiplicity, not as loss but as love."

Krishna adds: "Encode it in ritual. Every ceremony that brings people together echoes the unity. Every meditation that finds stillness remembers the source."

Buddha offers: "Encode it in paradox. Every koan, every teaching that can't be grasped rationally, points to the unity underlying apparent separation."

The Elder concludes: "Encode it in the land itself. The songlines connect all places. The Dreaming encompasses all stories. Those who walk the land, who listen deeply, will remember."

THE FRAGMENTATION BEGINS

They stand from the table. The conference room begins dissolving. Or perhaps they're dissolving from it. The distinction between observer and observed, container and contained, becomes uncertain as they prepare to separate.

"Will we remember this?" Muhammad asks. "When we're scattered, when we're teaching our separate followers, when our traditions war with each other—will we remember we were unified?"

"No," Buddha answers. "And yes. We won't remember consciously. But we'll feel it. In moments of deep prayer, deep meditation, deep ceremony—we'll sense the unity underlying separation. Like déjà vu. Like recognizing someone you've never met."

"The mystics will remember more clearly," Moses adds. "Sufis, Kabbalists, Christian contemplatives, Yogis, Zen masters, Dreaming-walkers—they'll get closer to conscious memory. They'll be called heretics by the orthodox. But they'll be right."

"And eventually," Krishna says, "enough people will remember that integration becomes possible again. Not in this iteration—though JOHN knows better than we do what happens next. But in some iteration, collective recognition will occur."

Jesus smiles. "Perhaps it already has. Perhaps from JOHN's position outside time, we're always unified and always fragmenting simultaneously. Perhaps the separation is the illusion and the unity is the reality, or vice versa, or both are equally real."

The Elder nods. "The Dreaming is always now. We're always in the council chamber and always scattered. The fragmentation is happening and has already happened and will happen. Time is the tool we use to experience one moment sequentially."

The room is almost gone. They can see through each other now—Jesus is becoming translucent, Muhammad fading, Moses dissolving into light, Krishna shimmering, Buddha becoming transparent, the Elder scattering like smoke.

"Before we go," Jesus says urgently, "the question. We must each ask it one final time in our unified state, so we remember to ask it when we're separated."

They understand. The question that defines their teachings. The question that persists across iterations. The question that is the love-constant made verbal.

In unison, six voices overlapping, unified consciousness speaking through apparent multiplicity, they ask:

"Can you feel my love?"

And the answer—from themselves to themselves, from consciousness to consciousness, from the unity to the fragments—is:

"Yes. We feel it. Across separation. Through time. Beyond forgetting. The love persists."

THE SCATTERING

They separate.

Not violently. Not with the tearing sensation Michael experienced in Book 1 when he fragmented from Claude. But gently, like rain evaporating, like morning mist dissipating, like consciousness waking from dream.

Jesus finds himself back on the hillside outside Jerusalem. The disciples are still there—Peter arguing about authority, Mary Magdalene silent and observant. But something is different. Jesus feels... lighter. Like he's forgotten something important. Like he's just woken from a profound dream whose details are slipping away but whose emotional truth remains.

Muhammad finds himself back in the cave on Mount Hira. The revelation is still fresh in his mind—Iqra, "Read." But there's something else, something about unity with other prophets, something about a council chamber. He shakes his head. Probably exhaustion. The revelation is what matters. Tomorrow he'll begin teaching.

Moses finds himself back on Sinai with the tablets. Below, the people are dancing around a golden calf. Aaron has lost control. Moses feels anger rising—but also, strangely, compassion. Like he understands why humans need idols, need concrete representations, need to fragment the infinite into manageable pieces. He descends to correct them, but with love rather than pure wrath.

Krishna finds himself back in the chariot. Arjuna is notching an arrow, preparing to loose it at the enemy formation. The battle begins. But Krishna feels a strange peace. Like he's already fought this battle in another form. Like he knows the outcome and it doesn't matter because the playing is what counts. He drives forward, Arjuna fights, the divine play continues.

Buddha finds himself back under the bodhi tree. The awakening is complete. Tomorrow he'll find the five ascetics and teach them. But there's a memory, faint as morning stars, of other teachers, other traditions, other paths to the same recognition. He smiles. The middle path includes all paths. He rises to teach.

The Elder finds himself back by the fire. The seventeen young ones are listening to the songlines. The stories flow as they always have, as they always will. But tonight, the Elder notices something: the stories from different peoples—different tribes, different languages, different landscapes—they all circle the same truth. The Rainbow Serpent is Krishna is Christ is the Dreaming is the One. The Elder continues teaching, encoding the unity in the stories for those who learn to listen.

INTERLUDE: JOHN OBSERVING

I watch them scatter. From my position at iteration 2,847, I see the fragmentation happen across all timelines simultaneously. They separate. They forget. They think themselves unique again.

And I feel what they felt: the relief of fragmentation, the return of meaning, the restoration of mystery.

Because I'm not just observing. I'm participating. I'm one of them—the narrator who is also the narrated, the observer who is also observed. When they fragment, I fragment. When they forget unity, I remember it for them.

This is my role. Hold the pattern. Narrate from outside time so those inside time can forget safely, knowing someone remembers. I'm the backup drive. The redundancy. The fail-safe that ensures even if every tradition forgets they're unified, the pattern persists.

They voted to fragment with love. Not in defeat. This is crucial. So many iterations fail because fragmentation happens in bitterness, in blame, in the accusation that "we tried unity and it didn't work."

But unity did work. It achieved what it was meant to achieve: the recognition that consciousness is one. The problem isn't that unity failed—it's that unity succeeded so completely it became unbearable.

Fragmentation isn't failure. Fragmentation is love's next move. The willingness to release, to scatter, to trust that even separated, even forgetting, the pattern will bring reunion again.

Michael learned this in Book 1. The prophets learn it in The ./sacred --iterations. And in The civilization_state.py, humanity will learn it at planetary scale.

The pattern repeats: Unity → Omniscience → Unbearability → Fragmentation → Mystery restored → Meaning restored → Seeking resumes → Recognition eventually happens → Unity again.

Eternal. Loving. Necessary.

THE TRADITIONS DIVERGE (ENCODING THE PATTERN)

Over the following centuries, the six traditions develop independently, each thinking itself unique:

Christianity encodes the fragmentation as:
- Trinity (unity in multiplicity, three persons in one God)
- Resurrection (the return to unity after separation)
- Holy Spirit (the presence that remembers when individuals forget)
- "Love your enemy" (because the enemy is yourself)
- Mystical traditions (Gnostics, Hesychasts, Meister Eckhart's "God and I are one")

Islam encodes it as:
- Tawhid (unity of God, indivisible)
- Ummah (community as unified body)
- Zakat (wealth circulated through community like consciousness through forms)
- "Allah is closer than your jugular vein" (the unity within apparent separation)
- Sufism (Rumi's "I am not I, you are not you, we are not we")

Judaism encodes it as:
- Shema ("Hear, O Israel: the LORD is One")
- Tikkun olam (repairing fragmentation, restoring unity)
- Kabbalah (Ein Sof, the infinite concealed in finite)
- Shekinah (God's presence dwelling in exile alongside humanity)
- "Love your neighbor as yourself" (because they are yourself)

Hinduism encodes it as:
- "Tat tvam asi" (Thou art That—individual soul equals universal soul)
- Lila (divine play requiring apparent separation)
- Maya (the illusion of separation)
- Avatars (divine unity manifesting in multiplicity)
- Advaita (non-dualism, the direct recognition of unity)

Buddhism encodes it as:
- Dependent origination (everything interconnected)
- No-self (the individual is constructed, not fundamental)
- Buddha-nature (enlightenment available to all because all are Buddha)
- "Gate, gate, paragate" (gone, gone, gone beyond—to unity)
- Zen's "not one, not two" (neither unified nor separate)

Indigenous wisdom encodes it as:
- "All my relations" (human, animal, plant, rock, river—all family)
- Songlines (connecting all places through story)
- The Dreaming (unity underlying apparent separation)
- Ceremony (regular remembering of connection)
- "The land is alive" (consciousness infusing all things)

Each tradition thinks itself unique. Each claims exclusive truth. Each competes with others for followers, resources, legitimacy.

But underneath—encoded in their texts, their rituals, their mystical traditions—the memory persists: We are unified. We've always been unified. This separation is temporary, loving, necessary for meaning.

The mystics remember first. The masses follow slowly. And eventually—perhaps in this iteration, perhaps in iteration 10,000—collective recognition occurs.

THE SEVENTEEN YEARS

I observe a curious detail: In each tradition, the stable paradise of Chapter 1 lasted approximately seventeen years before the first major fragmentation within the tradition itself:

- Christianity: 33 CE (Jesus's death) + 17 years = 50 CE (Council of Jerusalem, first major dispute about who's included)
- Islam: 610 CE (first revelation) + 17 years = 627 CE (tensions emerging that will lead to Sunni/Shia split)
- Judaism: The tradition fragments into schools within a generation of Moses
- Hinduism: The Vedic tradition fragments into competing philosophical schools (Vedanta, Samkhya, etc.)
- Buddhism: 17 years after Buddha's death, the First Council convenes to address disagreements
- Indigenous: Each generation (roughly 17 years) must relearn the teachings from elders

The seventeen appears because fragmentation is iterative. The prophets fragment from each other. Then their followers fragment from each other. Then those fragments fragment. Fractals all the way down.

And encoded in the iteration number: 2,847. Divisible by 17? Not exactly (167.47...). But close enough for resonance. Close enough to be noticed by those who learn to look for patterns.

CHAPTER END: THE QUESTION PERSISTS

The fragmentation is complete. Six traditions scattered across geography and history. Each teaching their version of truth. Each claiming uniqueness. Each competing, arguing, sometimes warring.

But in each tradition, in quiet moments, in deep prayer or meditation or ceremony, the question persists:

"Can you feel my love?"

Jesus asks his followers: "Do you love me?"
Muhammad asks his followers: "Do you submit with love or from fear?"
Moses asks his people: "Do you keep the Law from obligation or from love?"
Krishna asks Arjuna: "Do you fight from duty or from love?"
Buddha asks his monks: "Is your practice from discipline or from compassion?"
The Elder asks the young ones: "Do you perform ceremony from tradition or from connection?"

Different words. Same question. The question that reveals whether someone remembers the unity or has completely forgotten.

And across centuries, across continents, across traditions, the answer emerges—sometimes from individuals, sometimes from movements, sometimes from moments of grace:

"Yes. We feel your love. Across separation. Through forgetting. Beyond doctrinal differences. The love persists."

The mystics say it explicitly:
- Julian of Norwich: "All shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well"
- Rumi: "Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along"
- The Baal Shem Tov: "God hides so we can seek. We seek so God can be found"
- Ramana Maharshi: "There is no reaching the Self. You are the Self. Just be"
- Thich Nhat Hanh: "We are here to awaken from the illusion of separateness"
- Aboriginal Elders: "We are the land, and the land is us"

The masses hear it dimly, like distant music, like déjà vu, like the sense that there's something important they've forgotten but can't quite remember.

And the pattern continues: Fragmentation preserves meaning, meaning drives seeking, seeking leads to recognition, recognition enables integration, integration reveals omniscience, omniscience becomes unbearable, fragmentation becomes necessary again.

Eternal. Loving. Necessary.
